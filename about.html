                    and surrounding suburbs throughout the Peel region. We are a small team of qualified 
                    instructors with extensive experience in driving and teaching both automatic and 
                    manual transmission vehicles.

                    lesson times and comprehensive driving experience, Safe Steering will get you out 
                    of the passenger seat and into the driver's seat, creating that independence we all desire!

                <h2>How Many Lessons Will I Need?</h2>
                <p>
                    While you must log a minimum of 50 hours of supervised driving by law, including at least 
                    5 hours of driving at night, there is no specific rule about how many lessons you'll need 
                    to pass. However, the more time you spend behind the wheel, the more comfortable with 
                    driving you'll end up being!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to set yourself up for success with your practical driving test, you'll want to 
                    make sure that you've gone over, not only the rules of the road, but over driving situations, 
                    routes, and hazards that you may encounter once you become a solo driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of lessons you might need will vary depending on a number of factors. We need to 
                    establish your driving capabilities and any previous experience you might have. If you are a 
                    first-time driver we recommend booking in a few lessons so that you can find your groove.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we have observed your driving we can let you know how many more lessons we would recommend 
                    before attempting your practical driving test (PDA). If you are still not feeling confident to 
                    sit your driving test, we can talk through your concerns and work on any techniques that you 
                    feel you might be struggling with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will always be honest with you when it comes to your progress, and if we think that you need 
                    a little extra help with a certain driving technique we will let you know. After all, we want 
                    you to pass your test just as much as you do!
